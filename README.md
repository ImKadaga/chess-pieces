# Xiangqi (Chinese chess)

### Wikipedia Intl modified piece set

Modified versions of the pieces from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Xiangqi_Board.svg) made by [Inductiveload](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Inductiveload). I fixed the strokes, made the King pieces symmetric and redrew the horse and the elephant pieces. The board is also from Wikipedia but I recolored the palace and the river.
